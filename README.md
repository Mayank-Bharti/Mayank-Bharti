# Hey there! 👋 I'm Mayank Bharti

Welcome to my GitHub corner, where I'm constantly exploring, building, and learning!



## 🔭 Currently Working On
Right now, I'm focused on strengthening my algorithm skills and diving deep into **MERN stack development**.  
I’m aiming to build efficient, scalable applications and solve challenging problems.



## 🌱 Learning Journey
I’m on a **learning spree**, delving into:
- **Open-source contributions** 🌍
- **DevOps** 🌐

Alongside, I'm brushing up on core **Computer Science fundamentals**:
- **Database Management Systems (DBMS)**
- **Networking**
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOPS)**
- **Operating Systems (OS)**
- **Compiler Design**

Each day brings something new to learn, and I’m excited about every bit of it! 🚀



## 👯 Looking to Collaborate On
